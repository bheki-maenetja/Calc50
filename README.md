## Overview
Calc50 is a mobile iOS calculator application built with Swift and Xcode. The application allows users to do simple and complex arithmetic calculations as well as unit conversion and calculations involving time and date. The app is comprised of four calculators: a simple arithmetic calculator, a calculator for more complex operations such as logarithmic and trigonometric functions, a unit converter and a calculator for calculating the time between two different dates.

### Simple Calculator
- The simple calculator works much the same way as any other mobile calculator app. Users can perform simple calculations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Users can also work with percentages.

### Advanced Calculator
- The advanced calculator works by first asking the user to first enter a number through a native keyboard provided by iOS. The user can then apply a multitude a mathematical functions including those related to trigonometry, logarithms, exponents and surds.

### Unit Converter
- The unit converter allows users to convert units of area, energy, length, mass, speed, temperature, time and volume. The user uses a series of UIPickerViews to select the category of units, the unit to be converted from and the unit to be converted to. The user will then enter an integer value to convert from the first unit to the second unit.

### Date Calculator
- The date calculator allows to calculate the time between any two calendar dates. This time can be expressed in different units such as seconds, days, weeks and hours.
